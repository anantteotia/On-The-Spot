A cab sharing system is a transportation service that allows multiple passengers to share a single vehicle while traveling to similar destinations. The system is designed to reduce traffic congestion, save fuel costs, and provide an eco-friendly mode of transportation.

The cab sharing system works by matching passengers traveling in the same direction and grouping them together in a single vehicle. The system is usually facilitated through a mobile app or a website that allows passengers to enter their starting point, destination, and preferred travel time. The system then matches them with other passengers traveling in the same direction and assigns a vehicle and driver to pick them up.

The cab sharing system offers various benefits, including reduced transportation costs for passengers, reduced traffic congestion on roads, and reduced carbon emissions. Additionally, it offers a convenient and affordable mode of transportation for individuals who do not own a car or prefer not to drive.

The cab sharing system is increasingly becoming popular in urban areas as it offers an affordable and eco-friendly transportation option. It is also being adopted by companies as a cost-effective and efficient mode of employee transportation.
